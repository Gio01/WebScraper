Web Scraper for 30 Yourself App

30Yourself is a productivity app crated using Ionic and React. Within the app users are able to create goals with tasks they will do to accomplish their goals.

The purpose of this WebScraper is to give users, from the 30Yourself app, user specific suggestions on how they can complete their goals by having 
this scaper get information from Google searches. Being able to automate the task of seaching for helpful tips/task on how a user can complete their goals,
can not only help the user but also enhance the user experience on the app.

This is a prototype for understanding how web scraping works and to see if the scraper can be used in a dynamic way to taylor to the different users
on 30Yourself.


The Web Scraper is hosted using Scrapy Cloud.

Future Goals:

Add user scraped data into a database so that it can get rendered in the app for each user to see.
Protentially introduce Machine Learning so that we can automate the task of looking at user trends and be able to create better suggestions for each user based on what things they decide to add to their goals list.
