[] Format the data with pandas and output it to a csv file
[] Connect a database to the parser so that once we have the data it gets
	stored into the database and we can then query from there!
[] Figure out how to get user input for create the query and have that 
	be customizable instead of me harcoding the 'coffee+shop' for
	the query
	Idea: I can have an input arg[] into the script which I can use
	to pass in the input for each user. Get some keywords based on
	goals that they have made and use that to create their filters
	Maybe have an option to search for suggestions and then the 
	user can input some keyword and then have that be send to the
	spider -> scrape data -> store to the db -> query the spider db
	-> send the data suggestions to the user and then have that be 
	used for creating their goals??
